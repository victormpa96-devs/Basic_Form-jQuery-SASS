Basic form of a sports center. In this form we have worked "HTML" with sending mandatory data, valid data checking (such as NIF/NIE), "STYLES" with Sass and "JS" with jQuery.

# How to launch:
To simulate a real server, we can use live-server extension in VS-Code, load the proyect with Xampp or launch the index with Web-Dev-Server, among other alternatives...

(Requires Node 18: https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer)
